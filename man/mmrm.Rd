Should be NULL or a numeric vector.}

\item{reml}{(\code{flag})\cr whether restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation is used,
otherwise maximum likelihood (ML) is used.}

\description{

This is the main function fitting the MMRM.
}
\details{
The \code{formula} typically looks like:
\code{FEV1 ~ RACE + SEX + ARMCD * AVISIT + us(AVISIT | USUBJID)}
so specifies response and covariates as usual, and exactly one special term
defines which covariance structure is used and what are the time point and
subject variables. The covariance structures in the formula can be
found in \code{\link{covariance_types}}.

The time points have to be unique for each subject. That is,
there cannot be time points with multiple observations for any subject.
The rationale is that these observations would need to be correlated, but it
is not possible within the currently implemented covariance structure framework
to do that correctly.

When optimizer is not set, first the default optimizer
(\code{L-BFGS-B}) is used to fit the model. If that converges, this is returned.
If not, the other available optimizers from \code{\link[=h_get_optimizers]{h_get_optimizers()}},
including \code{BFGS}, \code{CG} and \code{nlminb} are
tried (in parallel if \code{n_cores} is set and not on Windows).
If none of the optimizers converge, then the function fails. Otherwise
the best fit is returned.
}
\note{
The \code{mmrm} object is also an \code{mmrm_fit} and an \code{mmrm_tmb} object,
therefore corresponding methods also work (see \code{\link{mmrm_tmb_methods}}).
In addition it contains the Jacobian information \code{jac_list} and the \code{call}.
Use of the package \code{emmeans} is supported, see \code{\link{emmeans_support}}.
