\title{Calculation of Between-Within Degrees of Freedom for Multi-Dimensional Contrast}
\usage{
h_df_md_bw(object, contrast)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{(\code{mmrm})\cr the MMRM fit.}

\item{contrast}{(\code{matrix})\cr numeric contrast matrix, if given a \code{numeric}
then this is coerced to a row vector. Note that this should not include
elements for singular coefficient estimates, i.e. only refer to the
actually estimated coefficients.}
}
\value{
List with \code{num_df}, \code{denom_df}, \code{f_stat} and \code{p_val} (2-sided p-value).
}
\description{
Used in \code{\link[=df_md]{df_md()}} if method is "Between-within".
