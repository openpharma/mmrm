# mmrm 0.1.4

- First CRAN version of the package.
- The package fits mixed models for repeated measures
  (MMRM) based on the marginal linear model without random effects.
- The motivation for this package is to have a fast, reliable (in terms of
  convergence behavior) and feature complete implementation of MMRM in R.

### New Features

- Currently 10 covariance structures are supported (unstructured; as well as
  homogeneous and heterogeneous versions of Toeplitz, auto-regressive order one,
  ante-dependence, compound symmetry; and spatial exponential).
- Fast C++ implementation of Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Restricted Maximum
  Likelihood (REML) estimation.
- Currently Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom calculation is supported.
- Interface to the `emmeans` package for computing estimated marginal means
  (also called least-square means) for the coefficients.
- Multiple optimizers are run to reach convergence in as many cases as possible.
- Flexible formula based model specification and support for standard S3 methods such
  as `summary`, `logLik`, etc.
