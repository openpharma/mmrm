# model

we have the following model

\[
  y = X\beta + \epsilon
\]

and for prediction, we have

\[
  \hat{y_{new}} = X_{new}\hat\beta
\]


where
\[
  \epsilon \sim N(0, \Sigma)
\]
and
\[
  \hat\beta \sim N(\beta, cov(\beta))
\]

# confidence interval

confidence interval is calculated as the variance of $\hat{y}$

\[
  Var(\hat{y_{new}}) = X_{new} cov(\beta) X_{new}^\top
\]

and we can use normal approximation (1.96 +- sd) to obtain the interval.

# prediction interval

for prediction interval, we have

\[
  y_{new} = X_{new}\hat\beta + \epsilon
\]

\[
  Var(y_new|\theta) = X_{new} cov(\beta) X_{new}^\top + \Sigma
\]
where $\Sigma$ and $\beta$ are all function of $\theta$

\[
  E(y_{new}|\theta) = X_{new} \beta
\]

and

\[
  Var(y_{new}) = Var(E(y_{new}|\theta)) + E(Var(y_{new}|\theta))
\]

## Sampling approach

To obtain $Var(y_{new})$, we need to integrate over $\theta$ to obtain the expected variance and vairance of expectation.

However, if we use simulation based approach, we can:

1. Sample $\theta$
2. Obtain $Var(y_{new}|\theta)$ and $E(y_{new}|\theta)$
3. Summarize over $\theta$

to obtain the variance.
