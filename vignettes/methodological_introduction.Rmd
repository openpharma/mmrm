# Abstract

Mixed models for repeated measures (MMRMs) are frequently used in the analysis of data from clinical trials. 
They are suited to model continuous variables which were repeatedly measured at discrete time points.
In a clinical trial, these time points are typically visits according to a pre-defined schedule.
The distinguishing feature of MMRMs, compared to other implementations of mixed models, is that subject-specific random random effects that are not of direct interest are considered as residual effects, i.e. are part of the error correlation matrix.
This vignette provides a brief introduction to MMRMs from a methodological perspective. 
It contrasts MMRMs to other statistical models for longitudinal data, such as linear mixed effects models (with random intercept and/or slopes) and models based on generalized estimating equations (GEEs). 
The aim is to provide a basic orientation and guide for applied statisticians regarding model choice and possible ways of software implementation. 



# Mixed model for repeated measures

<!-- 
Ideas: 
A general, textbook-like, introduction which outlines MMRM and how it works with a 
focus on key references. 
It will provide s plainly written description, and frame mmrm in contrast to 
random slope intercept / glm / ... model. 
Why do we use mmrm rather than other models. 
data types, covariance structures, existing implementations in R and SAS proc mixed
misnomer of "mixed model", since we are actually marginalizing out the random effects
-->
<!-- 

The association between repeated measurements on the same patients can be modeled as a function of random effects, residual effects, or both.

-->

The descripton of MMRMs in this vignettes is based on @Mallinckrodt2017.
