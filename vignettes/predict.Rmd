## Prediction of conditional mean

Since residuals can be correlated, potentially existing observed outcomes
of the same individual can be informative for predicting the unobserved 
valued of the same individual.

Assume that the data is sorted such that $Y_{ij} = y_{ij}, j = k+1, k+2, \dots, p$ are
observed and $Y_{ij}, j = 1, 2, \dots, k$ are not.
The special case of all outcomes being unobserved (new individual) is covered
with $k=p$.

Let further 
$$
\Sigma_i(X_i, \theta) = \begin{pmatrix} \Sigma_i^{new,new}(X_i,\theta) & \Sigma_i^{new,old}(X_i,\theta)\\ \Sigma_i^{old,new}(X_i,\theta) & \Sigma_i^{old,old}(X_i,\theta)\end{pmatrix}
$$

be a block decomposition where
$\Sigma_i^{new,new}(X_i,\theta) = \Big(\big(\Sigma_i(X_i,\theta)\big)_{j,l}\Big)_{j = 1\dots k,\, l = 1\ldots k}$ and
similarly for the other blocks.

Predictions can then be made based on the conditional distribution
$$
Y_{i, 1\ldots k}\,|\,X_i,Y_{i,k+1\ldots p}=y_{i, k+1\ldots p}\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu_i, A_i)
$$

with 

$$
\mu_i(\beta,\theta) = (X_i \ \beta)_{1\ldots k} +  \Sigma_i^{new,old}(X_i,\theta) \, \Big(\big(\Sigma_i^{old,old}(X_i,\theta)\big)^{-1} \big(y_i^{k+1\ldots p} -  (X_i \ \beta)_{k+1\ldots p}\big)\Big)
$$
and

$$
A_i(\beta, \theta) = \Sigma_i^{new,new}(X_i,\theta) - \Sigma_i^{old,new}(X_i,\theta) \Big(\Sigma_i^{old,old}(X_i,\theta)\Big)^{-1} \Sigma_i^{new,old}(X_i,\theta) \ .
$$
Note that $A_i$ does not depend on $\beta$.
For implementing `predict()`, only $\widehat{\mu}_i:=\mu_i(\widehat{\beta},\widehat{\theta})$
is required.

For `predict(interval = "confidence")` additionally standard errors are required.
These could be derived using the delta methods since $\mu_i$ is a function of the
estimated model parameters $\beta$ and $\theta$.
This would require the Jacobian $\nabla\mu_i(\beta,\theta)|_{\big(\widehat{\beta},\widehat{\theta}\big)}$ 
in addition to the estimated variance covariance matrix of the parameter estimate
$\big(\widehat{\beta},\widehat{\theta}\big)$, $\widehat{S}$.
Standard errors for $\widehat{\mu}^{\,(i)}$ are then given by the square root of 
the diagonal elements of
$$
\Big(\nabla\mu_i(\beta,\theta)|_{\big(\widehat{\beta},\widehat{\theta}\big)}\Big)^\top\quad \widehat{S} \quad \Big(\nabla\mu_i(\beta,\theta)|_{\big(\widehat{\beta},\widehat{\theta}\big)}\Big)
$$
For `predict(interval = "prediction")` one would use the square root of the 
diagonal elements of $A_i\big(\widehat{\beta},\widehat{\theta}\big)$ instead.
The delta method could again be used to make upper and lower boundaries reflect
parameter estimation uncertainty.

Alternatively, both intervals can be derived using a parametric bootstrap sample
of the unrestricted parameters $\theta$.
This would probably also be easier for the `= "prediction"` case.

Please note that for these intervals, we assume that the distribution is approximately normal: we use $\mu_{i,j}(\hat\beta, \hat\theta) \pm Z_{\alpha} * sqrt(A_{i, j, j}(\hat\beta, \hat\theta))$
to construct it, where $\mu_{i,j}(\hat\beta, \hat\theta)$ is the $j$th element of $\mu_i(\hat\beta, \hat\theta)$, $A_{i, j, j}(\hat\beta, \hat\theta)$ is the $j,j$ element of $A_i(\hat\beta, \hat\theta)$.

### Parametric Sampling for prediction interval

With the conditional variance formula

\[
  Var(Y_i) = Var(E(Y_i|\theta)) + E(Var(Y_i|\theta))
\]

the conditional expectation $E(Y_i|\theta)$ and the conditional variance $Var(Y_i|\theta)$ are already described

\[
  E(Y_i|\theta) = \mu_i(\beta,\theta)
\]

\[
  Var(Y_i|\theta) = A_i(\beta, \theta)
\]

so we can sample on $\theta$ and obtain $\beta$, then calculate the variance of conditional mean and the mean of conditional variance.

### Prediction of conditional mean for new subjects

If there are no observations for a subject, then the prediction is quite simple:

\[
  Y_i = X_i \hat\beta
\]
