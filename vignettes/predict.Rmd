## Prediction of conditional mean

### Mathematical Derivations

Since residuals can be correlated, potentially existing observed outcomes
of the same individual can be informative for predicting the unobserved
valued of the same individual.

Assume that the data is sorted such that $Y_{ij} = y_{ij}, j = k+1, k+2, \dots, p$ are
observed and $Y_{ij}, j = 1, 2, \dots, k$ are not.
The special case of all outcomes being unobserved (new individual) is covered
with $k=p$.

Let further
$$
\Sigma_i(X_i, \theta) = \begin{pmatrix} \Sigma_i^{new,new}(X_i,\theta) & \Sigma_i^{new,old}(X_i,\theta)\\ \Sigma_i^{old,new}(X_i,\theta) & \Sigma_i^{old,old}(X_i,\theta)\end{pmatrix}
$$

be a block decomposition where
$\Sigma_i^{new,new}(X_i,\theta) = \Big(\big(\Sigma_i(X_i,\theta)\big)_{j,l}\Big)_{j = 1\dots k,\, l = 1\ldots k}$ and
similarly for the other blocks.

Predictions can then be made based on the conditional distribution
$$
Y_{i, 1\ldots k}\,|\,X_i,Y_{i,k+1\ldots p}=y_{i, k+1\ldots p}\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu_i, A_i)
$$

with

$$
\mu_i(\beta,\theta) = (X_i \ \beta)_{1\ldots k} +  \Sigma_i^{new,old}(X_i,\theta) \, \Big(\big(\Sigma_i^{old,old}(X_i,\theta)\big)^{-1} \big(y_i^{k+1\ldots p} -  (X_i \ \beta)_{k+1\ldots p}\big)\Big)
$$
and

$$
A_i(\beta, \theta) = \Sigma_i^{new,new}(X_i,\theta) - \Sigma_i^{old,new}(X_i,\theta) \Big(\Sigma_i^{old,old}(X_i,\theta)\Big)^{-1} \Sigma_i^{new,old}(X_i,\theta) \ .
$$
Note that $A_i$ does not depend on $\beta$.

### Implementation of `predict`

For implementing `predict()`, only $\widehat{\mu}_i:=\mu_i(\widehat{\beta},\widehat{\theta})$
is required.

For `predict(interval = "confidence")` additionally standard errors are required.
These could be derived using the delta methods since $\mu_i$ is a function of the
estimated model parameters $\beta$ and $\theta$.
This would require the Jacobian $\nabla\mu_i(\beta,\theta)|_{\big(\widehat{\beta},\widehat{\theta}\big)}$
in addition to the estimated variance covariance matrix of the parameter estimate
$\big(\widehat{\beta},\widehat{\theta}\big)$, $\widehat{S}$.
Standard errors for $\widehat{\mu}^{\,(i)}$ are then given by the square root of
the diagonal elements of
$$
\Big(\nabla\mu_i(\beta,\theta)|_{\big(\widehat{\beta},\widehat{\theta}\big)}\Big)^\top\quad \widehat{S} \quad \Big(\nabla\mu_i(\beta,\theta)|_{\big(\widehat{\beta},\widehat{\theta}\big)}\Big)
$$
For `predict(interval = "prediction")` one would use the square root of the
diagonal elements of $A_i\big(\widehat{\beta},\widehat{\theta}\big)$ instead.
The delta method could again be used to make upper and lower boundaries reflect
parameter estimation uncertainty.

Alternatively, both intervals can be derived using a parametric bootstrap sample
of the unrestricted parameters $\theta$.
This would probably also be easier for the `= "prediction"` case.

Please note that for these intervals, we assume that the distribution is approximately normal: we use $\mu_{i,j}(\hat\beta, \hat\theta) \pm Z_{\alpha} * sqrt(A_{i, j, j}(\hat\beta, \hat\theta))$
to construct it, where $\mu_{i,j}(\hat\beta, \hat\theta)$ is the $j$th element of $\mu_i(\hat\beta, \hat\theta)$, $A_{i, j, j}(\hat\beta, \hat\theta)$ is the $j,j$ element of $A_i(\hat\beta, \hat\theta)$.

### Parametric Sampling for prediction interval

With the conditional variance formula

\[
  Var(Y_i) = Var(E(Y_i|\theta)) + E(Var(Y_i|\theta))
\]

the conditional expectation $E(Y_i|\theta)$ and the conditional variance $Var(Y_i|\theta)$ are already described

\[
  E(Y_i|\theta) = \mu_i(\beta,\theta)
\]

\[
  Var(Y_i|\theta) = A_i(\beta, \theta)
\]

so we can sample on $\theta$ and obtain $\beta$, then calculate the variance of conditional mean and the mean of conditional variance.

### Prediction of conditional mean for new subjects

If there are no observations for a subject, then the prediction is quite simple:

\[
  Y_i = X_i \hat\beta
\]

## Simulate response

To create simulation of responses from a fitted model, we have multiple situations: whether this simulation
is conditional on both $\theta$ and $\beta$, or it is marginal?

### Conditional Simulation

Under conditional simulation setting, the variance-covariance matrix, and the expectation of $Y_i$ are already
given in [Mathematical Derivations](#Mathematical-Derivations).

Please note that in implementation of `predict` function, we only use the diagonal elements, however, here
we need to make use of the full matrix $A_i$.

### Marginal Simulation

To simulate marginally, we take the variance of $\hat\theta$ and $\hat\beta$ into consideration.
For each simulation, we first generate $\theta$ assuming it approximately follows multi-variate normal distribution.
Then, conditional on $\theta$ we sampled, we generate $\beta$ also assuming it approximately follows multi-variate normal distribution.
Now we have $\theta$ and $\beta$ estimates, and we just follow the [conditional simulation](#conditional-simulation).
Repeat this step for multiple times and this is the marginal simulated response.

### Implementation of `simulate`

To implement `simulate` function, we first ensure that the expectation ($\mu$) and variance-covariance matrix ($A$) are generated
in `predict` function, for each of the subjects.

For `simulate(method = "conditional")`, we use the estimated $\theta$ and $\beta$ to construct the $\mu$ and $A$ directly, and generate
response with $N(\mu, A)$ distribution.

For `simulate(method = "marginal")`, for each repetition of simulation, we generate $\theta_{new}$ from the mmrm fit, where the estimate
of $\theta$ and variance-covariance matrix of $\theta$ are provided.
Using the generated $\theta_{new}$, we then obtain the $\beta_{new}$ and its variance-covariance matrix, with $\theta_{new}$ and
the data used in fit. Then we simulate once with `simulate(method = "conditional", beta = beta_new, theta = theta_new)`.
Pool all the repetition together and we get the marginal simulation results.

## Comparison with `SAS`

In `SAS`, from `proc mixed`, we are able to generate predictions using `outp` argument in `model` statement.
An example will be

```{sas eval=FALSE}
PROC MIXED DATA = fev_data method=reml;
  CLASS RACE(ref = 'Asian') AVISIT(ref = 'VIS4') SEX(ref = 'Male') ARMCD(ref = 'PBO') USUBJID;
  MODEL FEV1 = ARMCD / ddfm=Satterthewaite solution chisq outp=pred;
  REPEATED AVISIT / subject=USUBJID type=un r rcorr;
  LSMEANS ARMCD / pdiff=all cl alpha=0.05 slice=AVISIT;
RUN;
```

However, there are some differences between the `SAS` implementation and our `mmrm` package, described as follows:

1. While `mmrm` and `SAS` both provide predicted means (conditional on other observations) for unobserved records, `SAS` also provides predicted means for observed records while `mmrm` does not. The rationale is that in the `mmrm` package we want to be consistent with the notion of predictions conditional on the observed records - which means that observed records are observed and therefore there is no prediction uncertainty anymore.
1. The prediction standard error is different between `mmrm` and `SAS`. While in `SAS` the prediction standard error is conditional on the estimated variance parameters $\theta$, in `mmrm` the marginal prediction standard error is provided. The rationale is that in the `mmrm` package we want to take into account the full uncertainty about parameter estimates including $\theta$.
1. The prediction intervals in `SAS` are based on the t distribution, while currently in `mmrm` we use the normal distribution. We will be considering an extension towards using the t distribution in the future and welcome feedback on this detail.
